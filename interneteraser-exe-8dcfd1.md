InternetEraser.exe is an executable file associated with the Free Internet Eraser software developed by Cybertron Software, specifically version 4.0.0.0, which is designed to help users securely delete their internet browsing history, cache, cookies, and other potentially sensitive information to enhance privacy. While the application has legitimate uses, users should exercise caution as some antivirus programs may flag InternetEraser.exe as a potential threat, categorizing it as virus or malware due to its ability to alter system files and erase data.
